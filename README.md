### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Who I am: I'm Honglin Carson Bao. I am a computational social scientist in training currently working at Michigan State & NSF BEACON Center. I work closely with Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng (Communication and Media), Dr. Zachary Neal (Psychology), Koza Chair Professor Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf (Computer Science), and Dr. Misha Teplitskiy at the University of Michigan School of Information.

A word of research: I previously leveraged techniques like machine learning, social networks, and game theory to build social theory/metaphor-driven microscopic agent rules and study emergent macro-patterns at the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., agent-based social simulation/computational economics, with Artificial Life researchers and computational/evolutionary biologists. Recently I have been drawn to the real-world issues in data-driven computational social science and complex social systems. I have shifted to studying NLP- and found data-based social network/media/communication research and the sociology of science and innovation (aka Science of Science) with some "orthodox" social scientists and information science researchers. My goal is to produce impactful research in computational social science academia through cross-fertilizing observational (e.g., digital trace data), theoretical (e.g., simulation), and experimental (e.g., survey and virtual labs) studies.
