### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Who I am: I'm Honglin Carson Bao. I am a Ph.D. candidate and computational social scientist in training at MSU & NSF BEACON Center. I work closely with Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng (Communication and Media), Dr. Zachary Neal (Psychology and Sociology), and Koza Chair Professor Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf (Computer Science).

A word of research: I previously leveraged techniques like machine learning, social networks, and game theory to build social theory-driven microscopic agent rules and study emergent macro-patterns at the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., agent-based social simulation/computational economics, with Artificial Life researchers and computational/evolutionary biologists. Recently I have been drawn to the real-world issues in data-driven computational social science. I have shifted to study NLP- and found data-based (e.g., online user trace) social network/media/communication research and the sociology of science and innovation (aka Science of Science) with some social scientists and information science researchers. My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in computational social science academia through cross-fertilizing observational (e.g., trace data), theoretical (e.g., simulation), and experimental (e.g., virtual labs) studies.
